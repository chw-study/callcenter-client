    <p>"I am (your name) from Nestbuilders International (NBI), in Freetown. We are conducting a study analyzing the CHW program’s performance in Sierra Leone aiming to improve the national healthcare system. For this purpose, we would like you to help us by answering some questions about your experience as a patient with the CHW. </p>
    <p>The survey will take 5 minutes. Your answers are completely anonymous and confidential, meaning that they will not be shared with anybody in your community, the CHW, or the Ministry of Health and Sanitation. </p>
    <p>You are free to end the interview at anytime and refuse to answer any question that you’d like. May we have your permission to ask you some questions? In case you want to contact us in the future, you can contact the researcher in charge of the field work, Ms. Luz Azlor, at 077268824." </p></div>
